# Problem Statment 
Residential electricity use is a big part of overall energy demand, and utilities have to match that demand with supply in real time. When energy usage is hard to predict, it can drive up operating costs, increase reliance on carbon-heavy plants, and put extra strain on the grid. On the household side, having better forecasts of electricity use can help people make smarter choices such as adjusting thermostats, timing when they run appliances, or coordinating things like home batteries and EV charging. Therefore, our goal for this project is to predict hourly household electricity usage (Global_active_power) using past consumption patterns and related electrical measurements. 

We used the "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. [Link text](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/235/individual+household+electric+power+consumption). The data was collected from a single household over a period of almost 4 years, from December 2006 to November 2010. The dataset contains measurements of electric power consumption in one-minute intervals. We are using Global_active_power as our target variable.
